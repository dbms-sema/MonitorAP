        What is the AQI? The AQI is an index for reporting daily air quality. It tells you how clean
        or unhealthy your air is, and what associated health effects might be a concern. \n\n The AQI
        focuses on health affects you may experience within a few hours or days after breathing
        unhealthy air. The AQI is calculated for four major air pollutants regulated by the Clean
        Air Act: groundlevel ozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. \n\n For
        each of these pollutants, EPA has established national air quality standards to protect
        public health. EPA is currently reviewing the national air quality standard for
        nitrogen dioxide. If the standard is revised, the AQI will be revised as well. \n\n

  Good. \n
        The AQI value for your community is between 0 and 50. Air quality is satisfactory and poses
        little or no health risk.
